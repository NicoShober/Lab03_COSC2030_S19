# Lab03_COSC2030_S19
cosc 2030 lab 3 in the spring of 2019


Postfix notation
b b * 4 a * c * - sqrt b - 2 a * /

The operations of the postfix python file is to add numbers into a stack and then when it reaches a operator it does the operation,
the prefix python file needed to grab the operator and store it and then add numbers to a stack until it reaches another operator
and then do the computation, I know what i needed to do but I couldnt figure out how to implement it in python.
